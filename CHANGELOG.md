## Versioning Strategy

This project uses semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Pre-release Versions

- **Alpha** (`0.x.0-alpha.y`): Early development, unstable API
- **Beta** (`0.x.0-beta.y`): Feature-complete, API stabilizing
- **Release Candidate** (`0.x.0-rc.y`): Final testing before release

### Version Compatibility

| Version | Python | Rust | C++ | ARM Targets |
|---------|--------|------|-----|-------------|
| 0.1.x   | 3.8+   | 1.70+ | C++17 | Cortex-M4+ |
| 0.2.x   | 3.9+   | 1.75+ | C++17 | Cortex-M4+ |
