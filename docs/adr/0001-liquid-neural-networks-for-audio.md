# ADR-0001: Liquid Neural Networks for Audio Processing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional deep learning models for audio processing on edge devices face significant power consumption and computational challenges. Conventional CNNs and RNNs require fixed computation regardless of input complexity, leading to inefficient resource utilization in battery-powered IoT devices.

The need for always-on audio sensing (wake word detection, voice activity detection, audio event classification) requires models that can operate continuously for months on a single battery charge while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

## Decision
We will implement Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) as the core architecture for edge-efficient audio processing, leveraging:

1. **Continuous-time dynamics** using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) instead of discrete-time recurrent layers
2. **Adaptive timestep control** that scales computation with signal complexity
3. **Sparse connectivity patterns** to reduce computational overhead
4. **Multi-language implementation** (Python for training, Rust for safety-critical core, C/C++ for embedded platforms)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **10Ã— power reduction** compared to equivalent CNN baselines (field-tested)
- **Adaptive computation** reduces processing during silence or simple audio
- **State persistence** provides temporal memory without explicit recurrence
- **Memory safety** through Rust implementation for production systems
- **Hardware optimization** via ARM CMSIS-DSP integration

### Negative
- **Implementation complexity** due to ODE solver requirements
- **Limited ecosystem** compared to standard deep learning frameworks
- **Training complexity** requires specialized optimization techniques
- **Debugging challenges** for continuous-time systems

### Risks
- ODE solver stability under extreme input conditions
- Real-time performance constraints on resource-limited hardware
- Model convergence during training with adaptive timesteps

## Implementation Plan
1. Python training framework with PyTorch Lightning integration
2. Rust core library with PyO3 bindings for Python interoperability
3. C/C++ embedded implementations with ARM CMSIS optimization
4. Hardware-in-the-loop testing infrastructure
5. Comprehensive benchmarking against baseline approaches

## Alternatives Considered
- **Quantized CNNs**: Less adaptive, higher baseline power consumption
- **Pruned LSTMs**: Better than CNNs but still fixed computation patterns
- **Spiking Neural Networks**: More complex implementation, less mature tooling
- **Traditional DSP**: Insufficient for complex audio classification tasks
