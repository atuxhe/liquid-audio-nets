# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the liquid-audio-nets project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## Format
Each ADR follows the standard format:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, or Deprecated
- **Context**: The situation that necessitates a decision
- **Decision**: The chosen solution and approach
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes, risks, and trade-offs

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [0001](0001-liquid-neural-networks-for-audio.md) | Liquid Neural Networks for Audio Processing | Accepted | 2025-08-02 |
