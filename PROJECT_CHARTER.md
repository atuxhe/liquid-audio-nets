## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **ODE Solver Stability**: Numerical instabilities could affect reliability
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing, adaptive error control, fallback mechanisms
- **Hardware Performance**: May not meet power/latency targets on all platforms
  - *Mitigation*: Hardware-in-the-loop testing, optimization profiling
- **Market Adoption**: Competition from established TensorFlow Lite Micro ecosystem
  - *Mitigation*: Clear differentiation, superior benchmarks, strong documentation

### Medium Risk
- **Maintenance Burden**: Multi-language codebase increases complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Automated testing, clear interface boundaries, documentation
- **Training Convergence**: LNN training may be less stable than standard approaches
  - *Mitigation*: Research collaboration, robust optimization techniques

### Low Risk
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies reduce supply chain risk
- **Licensing Issues**: MIT license minimizes legal complications
